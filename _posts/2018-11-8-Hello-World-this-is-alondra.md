I like to write, one of the many reasons that I like to write is that you can come up with anything. You can create a new world and conducting the plot. Being able to create universes and the being in the universe Here’s an example of the stories I can make.

<hr />
<p style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#808080;">The name is 43789, I’m a human being that has been transported to different dimensions. Because of being contact in many different dimension, my face has been deformed and many beings hide their eyes from me. Jumping to dimension was meant to be my job, but Mother Universe have released my duty. The Mother Universe is what defines all dimensions and keeps in check of them. Since I was a second-hand degree matter, I was completely useless to the Mother Universe. I use to deliver the changes that the Mother Universe have made. On the process of moving to dimensions, I have been creating my own dimension with some materials of every dimension I encounter. If The Mother Universe had to find out, I will be exterminated or be thrown into the obis of space. Little by little I am able to construct my dimension as chaotic as possible. Slowly days, months and years passed by; I'm almost finished with my dimension. The thought of having my own dimension seems crazy, no one has ever gotten their own dimension except for The Mother Universe. I feel like I am The Mother Universe, but so much more. The Mother Universe have never done anything for me, but to show me I can do more.</span></p>

Moving on from storytelling, I am here to help and improve myself and to expand my perception. I want to learn more and be able to comprehend. From way beyond, learning has influenced and created to what's now today.
